NUnit setup
==============================================================================
In order to run the unit tests in Zot.Core.Test, you must add a NUNIT_LOC
environment variable that points to your current NUnit framework
distribution.  You must restart Visual Studio in order for it to be able to
find the new environment variable (where's my 'source .vsconfig' Microsoft!!).
This will also provide the flexibility to update the environment variable
whenever new NUnit distributions are made available without having to change
project settings.
